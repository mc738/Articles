# Type coercion in F#

Mapping base .net types to domain specific values.

## Introduction

One the big advantages of F# is the type system. This makes it's easy to map data to different domains and transform between them.
This, combined with .net base types can opens up a world of possiblities for writing solutions.

Some examples include:

* Mapping ADO.net database results to F# records.
* Writing configurable data processing pipelines.
* Parsing various formats such as CSV.
