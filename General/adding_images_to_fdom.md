# Adding images to FDOM

Experiences and testing of adding images to FDOM's markdown parse and Html renderer.

## Did it work?

If all went well, the following image should appear:

![Could not load but at least the alt text works](https://blog.psionic.cloud/img/ken-cheung-KonWFWUaAuk-unsplash.jpg "Successful image?"){ width:100% }

Here's hoping!!! Also [I added links](https://www.example.com), so hopefully they works too.
Also, hopefully fixed the issue with spaces being added after `.` like in `test.fs`!
